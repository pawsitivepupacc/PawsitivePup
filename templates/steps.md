## Step-by-step plan
1. **Set your environment:** Reduce distractions and prep high-value rewards.
2. **Short reps:** Train in 5â€“10 minute blocks, a few times per day.
3. **Mark and reward:** Use a clicker or a clear word like "Yes!"
4. **Increase difficulty gradually:** Add distance, duration, and distractions one at a time.
5. **End on a win:** Keep morale high and keep sessions fun.
