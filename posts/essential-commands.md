Raising a well-behaved dog starts with a few **simple, humane commands**. These basics build confidence and make daily life easier for both of you.

## 1) Name Recognition
Say your puppy’s name in a cheerful tone and reward eye contact. Short, frequent sessions work best.

## 2) Sit
Lure with a treat from nose to forehead; as the head tilts up, the bum will drop. Mark and reward.

## 3) Down
From a sit, guide the treat to the floor between paws. Patience matters—never push the dog.

## 4) Come
Use a long line in a safe area. Call once, kneel, and reward generously when your pup arrives.

## 5) Leave It
Present one treat in a closed fist; reward from the other hand the moment your pup disengages.

### Pro Tip
End sessions on a **win** and keep them under five minutes. Consistency beats intensity!
