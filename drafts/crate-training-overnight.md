Night whining is normal—your puppy is adjusting. This plan uses **gradual desensitization** and comfort cues.

1. **Daytime Introductions** – Feed meals in the crate; door open at first.
2. **Scent Comfort** – Place a worn t-shirt (your scent) near the crate.
3. **Short Reps** – 5–10 minute stays with a stuffed chew, multiple times daily.
4. **Bedtime Routine** – Potty break → calm cuddle → crate with chew → lights down.
5. **Responding at Night** – Brief potty trip if needed; quiet return, minimal talk.

In a week or two, most pups settle. Keep sessions short and positive.
